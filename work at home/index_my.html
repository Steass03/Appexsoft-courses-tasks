			“Air Max sneakers are special due to Tinker Hatfield’s incredible early
			designs. The Air Max 1 is one of the greatest sneakers ever, and the
					mystique of the Air Max line all starts there.” - Zack
		Designed by Tinker Hatfield, the Nike Air Max 1 was the first sneaker to offer
			a window to the sole. The out-of-the-box thinker was inspired by the
			Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris to design the sneaker that made its Air 
									technology visible.

		<p >
			Cutting Season. Like the Air Max 1 but (unsurprisingly) less weighty, Nike
			tweaked its successful silhouette with EVA foam for a brand-new feel.

		<p >
			Of the classics, I find that the Air Max 90 is the most comfortable. - Zack
			Originally dubbed the Air Max 3, The Nike Air Max 90 completely reworked
			the Air Max sneaker for the new decade. Still today, the Air Max 90 is one
			of the most popular sneakers in the world. Don’t even get us started on that
			Off-White collab

		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max Classic BW 1991 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_classic_bw.jpg" alt="nike_air_max">
			</div>
		<p >
			One incredibly important element to the greatness of Air Max is the fact that there are so many OG
			colourways that are now iconic, such as the Persian Violet OG iteration of the Nike Air Max BW. - Zack
			The Nike Air Classic BW was originally a sleeker version of the Air Max 90 with a bigger Air window (yes,
			the BW really does stand for ‘Big Window’). Most recently, the Nike Air Max BW has been updated with a
			full-length Air sole borrowed from the Air Max 97. First seen on a SKAir model by Skepta; we think the
			changes majorly upgrade the sneaker.

			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_180.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_180">
			</div>
		<p  >
			Time to get playful. The first Nike sneaker to display Air technology on its outsole, the Nike Air Max 180
			(180-degree views of visible air) was in many ways a departure from the tried-and-tested formula of the early Air Maxs.

		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 93 1993 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_93.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_93">
			</div>
		<p  >
			Created using a blow-moulding technique, the Air Max 93 (the original Air Max 270) took the design of the
			Air Max 180 and gave us coloured Air units (yess), a sock-like fit (yessss) and more air for our money (yassssss).

		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 94 1994 </h1>

			</div>
		<p >
			Entering more unfamiliar territory on our journey through Air Max history, the 1994 Air Max (predictably
			labelled the Air Max 94) is frequently overlooked or unknown by even the most avid sneaker collectors. So,
			what is it? It’s essentially a hybrid of the Nike Air Max Light and The Nike Air Max 93. And if you’re asking us,
			we think that makes it pretty damn cool.
		</p>

		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 2 1994 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_2.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_2">
			</div>
		<p >
			“My absolute favourite Air Max model is one that has still never had a re-release, the Air Max 2 from 1994.
			This was one of the last Air Maxs that Tinker Hatfield designed, and it introduced multiple Air chambers
			with different pressures for strategic cushioning and support (later found in the Air Max 95). The upper,
			speckled mudguard and different-coloured Air units in the heel all come together to make one incredible design.” - Zack

		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 2 Light 1994 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_2_light .jpg" alt="nike_air_max_2_light">
			</div>
		<p >
			Déjà vu. Just as they did with the original Air Max, Nike created a lighter version of the Air Max 2. However,
			unlike the 1s, the Air Max 2 Light proved more popular than its predecessor.
		</p>

		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 95 1995</h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_95.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_95">
			</div>
		<p  >
			A sneaker of subtle branding and striking form; the Sergio Lozano designed Air Max 95 was created with
			the human anatomy in mind (a fun fact which seems simultaneously cool and slightly gross). It’s important
			to note that the Air Max 95 marks an important milestone in the Nike Air Max timeline as the complete
			overhaul in design signifies the brand’s confidence in its relationship with their consumer. In short: by ‘95,
			they had us.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 96 1996 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_96.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_96">
			</div>
		<p >
			An original ‘chunky sneaker’; the Nike Air Max 96 has a lot in common with today’s most sought-after
			silhouettes. In fact, with its minimal branding, layered upper and bulky sole being so en-vogue, we’re
			anticipating a re-release in the near future.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 97 1997</h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_97.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_97">
			</div>
		<p >
			Finally, full-length Air cushioning. The Air Max 97 — designed by Christian Tressler and inspired by
			waterdrops making ripples in a pond — is the darling of the sneakerhead community. And while the OG
			colourway is often dubbed the ‘Silver Bullet’, the hue was in fact inspired by the silver sheen of mountain
			bikes. (We feel like our whole life has been a lie.)
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 98 1998</h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_98.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_98">
			</div>
		<p >
			If any Air Max encapsulates 90s fashion, it’s the Air Max 98. Mismatched design and bold, contrasting
			colours make the 1998 kicks one of the most eye-catching Nike releases ever.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max Plus 1998</h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_plus.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_plus">
			</div>
		<p >
			Florida: the location where Sean McDowell first envisioned a sneaker that drew inspiration from the beach.
			Palm trees swaying, colours of the sunset and sealife are all translated through design upon the Air Max
			Plus (better known as the Nike TN). It’s ironic then that the sneaker proved most popular in gloomy
			London. Why? Perhaps the vibrant sneaker was a form of escapism.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max Deluxe 1999 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_deluxe.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_deluxe">
			</div>
		<p >
			Inspired by European rave culture (which was all the rage in 1999); the upper of the Nike Air Max Deluxe
			upper is completely covered by digitally-printed neoprene. Just like a rave, the trance-inspired trainers
			were created to be loud, vibrant and youthful.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 2003 2003 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_2003.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_2003">
			</div>
		<p  >
			The first significant release of the 00s acted as a breath of fresh air after the chaotic aesthetics of the late
			90s. Monochromatic, clean and well-formed; the Nike Air Max 2003 (thought-up by Sergio Lozano of Air
			Max 95 fame) made promises of a sleeker feature.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 360 2006 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_360.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_360">
			</div>
		<p  >
			A performance-focused silhouette, the Nike Air Max 360 is built upon an Air unit that is visible from every
			angle (something you probably guessed from its name). It reflects a time in which a sneaker’s ability to be
			used in sports was regarded as highly important.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Vapormax Flyknit 2017 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_vapormax_flyknit.jpg" alt="nike_vapormax_flyknit">
			</div>
		<p >
			Return of the Max. That refined future Nike hinted at with the Air Max 2003 finally came 14 years later when
			the Flyknit Vapormax released. And oh boy, it was worth the wait. A Kathy Gomez design, the Vapormax is
			the first time the Air Unit stands alone as the sneaker’s sole. Combined with a flyknit upper, the feel and fit
			of the Vapormax is like no other.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 270 2018 </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_270.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_270">
			</div>
		<p  >
			In 2018, Nike looked back to their early 90s designs to inspire forward-thinking ideas — ideas to follow
			ever-growing interests in lifestyle sneakers. The result: a retrofuturistic sneaker that sparked interest with
			the brand-new Gen Z consumers.
		</p>
		<h3><a href = "#">leave your opinion about it!</a></h3>
		<h1 class = "title" >Nike Air Max 720 2019  </h1>
		<div class ="picture">
			<img src = "img_index_my/img_nike_air_max_720.jpg" alt="nike_air_max_720">
			</div>
		<p >
			The sequel to the 270, the Air Max 720’s space-age look and bulky Air unit (the tallest airbag of the Air
			Max timeline) come together to create one of the most exciting sneakers of the 21st Century.
